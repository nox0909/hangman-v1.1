            <h2>ABOUT JAVABAD: HANGMAN GAME</h2>
            <p>Know how this game works, and its background.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>JavaBad comes from the word Java; a programming language, and vad comes from the word "babad". 
                <br>
                <br>
                We come up with that name because we experience to soak in programming so that we can enhance our skills. It is also used because as a coder
                we need to be soaked not by the use of different media or websites but as well as learn by yourself for us to have the expected knowledge that should we have. 
                It contains quizzes that you can learn that are easy to analyze and understand because of the use of simple language, characters and numbers. 
                This game is references from the game called hangman that if you have incorrect answers the man will die or it will lose his body parts. We come up with this game because 
                we want beneficial activities that will help the unknowledgeable students learn coding, so that they will not be out of place to the students who background about it.</p>
